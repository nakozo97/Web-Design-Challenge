This assignment contains the following: 

* A [landing page](#landing-page) containing:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page [ Max Temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness, Wind Speed ]

* Four [visualization pages](#visualization-pages), each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.

* A ["Comparisons" page](#comparisons-page) that:
  * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so the reader can easily visually compare them.
  * Visualization Bootstrap grids with two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens. 

* A ["Data" page](#data-page) that:
  * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
    * The table is a bootstrap table component.
    * The data was exported from the `cities.csv` file in this repository. An HTML table `Data Page.html` is also located inside the repository. 

The website has a navigation menu that:

* Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
* Contains a dropdown menu on the right of the navbar named "Plots" that provides a link to each individual visualization page.
* Provides two more text links on the right: "Comparisons," which links to the comparisons page, and "Data," which links to the data page.
